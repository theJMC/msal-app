This is my template for an ExpressJS + Supabase projects. It includes the following:
- Basic Layout
- Navbar Partial
- Main Page
- 401/404 Page
- Customisable Title
- NPM Launch Scripts 

- Login
- Logout
- Register

Make sure to change the Supabase Credentials in the `app/static/js/common.js` file.
The `app/.env` file is not necessary.s
