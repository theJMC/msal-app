# MSAL Implementation Pub App
> This project is not complete, but it all *should* work. 

This is the application I developed while on Summer placement at Microsoft in 2024. Feel free to deploy this into your own environment, and do what you will with it! 

To Deploy this project, take a look at the [Deployment Documents](deploy.md), which should contain all the details needed. 

This project utilises Microsoft's Authentication Library (MSAL), alongside Azure Key Vault, and contains a deploy workflow to Azure Static Web Apps as well.
